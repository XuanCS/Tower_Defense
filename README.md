# Tower_Defense

Group Project of Tower Defense game is on Android phone platform. It contains the single-mode and the multi-player mode. In the single-player mode, the player has to build different type of towers to defend off enemies’ advancing. Coins which are consumed to build new towers can be earned by killing enemies. The Health point decreases if monsters break into the player’s home. The Crystals are limited but powerful item to eliminate all enemies on the map at once. In order to win the game, player need to consider the best location to build the tower efficiently. In the multi-players, two friends can play against each other. In the middle of the game, players are allowed to build towers, use crystals, pause or continue as well as end the game. Besides the basic game function in our project, we also have the database to store all account information including level, coins, experience etc. We have also implemented the function named “Add Friend”, that users can play against their friends via the Friend List before the game. For the sake of administration of the game, we have also created a website in which administrators can view, create, change and delete users’ information.
